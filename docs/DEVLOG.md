This is the devlog, which is how I built and things I did to the site.

This is a work in progress right now

# How I built it
InfinityGamer is built in HTML (a coding language to build sites), CSS (a coding language to style sites), JavaScript (a coding language to make site do cool things), and some SCSS (an extension on CSS). The site is deployed (put onto a site) statically (nothing is changed by the server, all files will stay the same).
